# 🧟‍♂️ Rust Zomboid Terminal Roguelike 🧟‍♂️

Yo, squad—welcome to Rust Zomboid Terminal, the terminal-based roguelike where you're the last survivor in a procedural suburb gone full "zombie yoga accident" (shoutout to those r/projectzomboid memes where one sprinter turns your safehouse into a Black Friday sale). Built in Rust with ratatui for that crisp ASCII glow-up, this jam's a love letter to Project Zomboid's "high-risk scavenge or starve" loop, but squeezed into your terminal like a noob's first horde run. Think: Overgrown lawns hiding shamblers, wrecked cars blocking alleys, radio crackles begging "Hurry to the mall—friend's holding the line!"—all in turn-based glory. No Electron bloat, just pure Rust magic: Zero-cost abstractions mean your framerate's as steady as a well-barricaded door.

# 🎮 Quick Start: From Cargo.toml to Cul-de-Sac Carnage

Clone, build, run—faster than a sprinter on caffeine
```rust
git clone https://github.com/xXNannu09Xx/ZomboidMania.git
cd ZomboidMania
cargo build
cargo run 
```

This is vibe coded but it made me love rust. more organic projects coming soon [^1]
